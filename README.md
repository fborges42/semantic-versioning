# semantic-versioning
The goal of this project is not to show code but rather to experiment the usage of conventional commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and semantic versioning (https://semver.org/) with https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version
There should be a couple of tagged versions on this repository from the tests.
